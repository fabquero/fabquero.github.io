## Resources and languages

Lots of free resources are used for this. You can find the resources (and resource references) on the website.

The site is entirely static. HTML, CSS and javascript are the main languages used.

## Rights

You are free to reuse the code, but you must change the content.

## Code organization

The code is organized as follows: in the main folder you will find the en and fr folders which contain the html pages in French and English respectively. In the style folder is the css pages of the site. Each html page has its own css file: file.css. Additionally there is a global file for the theme of the site. In this folder, there is also the theme of the template used. Finally, you can find the image folder which contains images specific to the website (icon, photo).
